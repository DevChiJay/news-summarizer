    "text": "Silence Sundays Bring Unexpected Calm — and Crowds — to Greendale. Greendale, April 21 — What began as a modest experiment by the town council has turned into a weekend ritual drawing visitors from three neighboring counties: Silence Sundays, a citywide pause on nonessential noise, entered its fourth month this week. Every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., construction, lawn mowers, and live amplified music are banned within city limits, replaced by acoustic street performers, slow-market vendors, and guided park meditations. We wanted people to rediscover the sound of the town, said Mayor Lina Ortega, who proposed the initiative as a public health measure to reduce stress and improve sleep. Small businesses initially feared a loss of weekend trade, but café owners report longer conversations and higher sales as visitors linger longer without the usual soundtrack of traffic and power tools. The local hospital recorded a 12 percent dip in stress-related ER visits on Sundays, according to City Health Director Amrita Patel. Commuters have adapted with quieter delivery windows and an expanded night-shift loading permit program for essential services. Not all residents are satisfied — a petition arguing the ordinance infringes on personal freedom to mow has gathered signatures and will be considered at next month's council meeting. Despite the controversy, hotels and B&Bs say booking rates are up 18 percent on Sundays, with many guests citing the novelty of a noise-free morning walk. The Greendale Farmers Market extended its hours to accommodate the increased foot traffic, and acoustic musicians report tips rivaling those at the town's spring fair. Social media has amplified the trend, with the hashtag #SilentSundays trending regionally after a viral video of a hush-happy street orchestra drew millions of views. Nearby towns are watching closely; two have already scheduled pilot programs for the summer. It's not about silence for silence's sake, said council member Jonah Reyes. It's about making room in the week for people to hear each other again. As Greendale navigates the balance between tranquility and freedom, one thing is clear: Sundays will never sound the same.",
